# Demand-Supply-Analysis

The demand for a product or service is the quantity of that product or service the customers are willing to purchase at any given price during a particular period.And the supply for a product or service is the quantity the producers are willing to provide in the market at a particular price and a particular period.

For the task of Demand and supply analysis, we need a dataset based on demand for a product or service and supply for a product or service.I found an ideal dataset or this, which is based on the demand for cab rides at a given time and the availability of drivers at a given time.
